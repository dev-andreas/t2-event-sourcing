This is the output of the simulation:

FATAL ERROR: power loss detected; global balance=€ 50,537,631
Shutting down...
Restarting systems...
Restoring last saved system state...
Restore successful; global balance=€ 50,573,672
Continuing normal operation.
Simulation finished; global balance=€ 98,860,506

You can observe that the global balance before the power loss is slightly lower than after the power loss.
This is likely due to the fact that all operations performed after the checkpoint are not persisted in the storage and, consequently, not restored.
